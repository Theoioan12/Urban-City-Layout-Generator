Feedback (Theodor):
It was a great project that challenged all my programming skills gained so far and all my algorithmical thinking. 
Even though I would have loved to test a lot more the algorithm and get to know its strengths and weaknesses, the time and resources were limited. 
I liked each part of developing the project and I enjoyed every second of coding. I wanted to incorporate in it all the OOP concepts 
I have while using all my algorithm design and analysis knowledge.

It was my first big project in python and I will take it as a success no matter the grade. Working with python made the development much easier and much faster, 
but I do believe that using a lower-level programming language (for example  C) could make it go faster when testing. The development process would take a lot, 
but is something I am willing to try in the future.

The project helped me understand better this subject and of course, now I will be able to use properly the ACO algorithm (at least I hope so:)). 
It is a nice project that for sure will appear in my CV and that helped me improve my skills in Python, PyCharm, GitHub and me more aware 
of the way that I wrote the code and how I make it reusable and how I document it. Of course soft skills like teamwork, communication and 
helping others were also developed a lot and I think I am better prepared for working in a company among other programmers.
